This project evaluates the biggest influences on the price of Ticketmaster music events. Using the Ticketmaster API, I evaluated variables to determine which had the strongest positive and negative correlation to the average cost of a concert ticket. After performing multiple heatmaps to evaluate the correction between variable and price, I determined which variables have the most significant impact. The strongest correlation is whether the event has a ticket limit of 4 or not. This was followed by whether the event is part of the Latin music genre. Having an opening act doesn't make a difference in the price, however, if an opening act is planned, the artist having a large number of upcoming events will make a significant impact. The final significant finding was that events taking place in Las Vegas are much higher correlated than in any other city or state in the world. 

I also created dropdown widgets to allow users to see the upcoming events in their city during a specific date, which will also filter based on music genre.
